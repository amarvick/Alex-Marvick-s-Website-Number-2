		<p id="mainParagraph">Hi! I'm Alex Marvick, and I appreciate you taking the time to check out my webpage. 
		   Here, you will find general information about me regarding my life, professional content, and much more.
		   Please feel free to skim around this site at your own leisure.</p>
		   
		<p>A little bit about me: I'm a Seattle native (Specifically, Bellevue) about to graduate with a B.S.
		   degree in Civil Engineering from Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA. I came over there primarily
		   because I knew their School of Engineering & Applied Science was very promising, especially due to
		   the small course sizes. My biggest motivation for choosing engineering came from a collection of
		   curiosity, creativity and a strong desire to create and solve puzzles. Outside of my classroom
		   studies, I took time independently to teach myself how to write code; both front and back end in
		   languages including C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I knew quickly this would
		   be an incredible skill set to have, granted I could do work both inside and outside a job environment.
		   Furthermore, I absolutely love doing work on a computer -- the independence, the creativity offered,
		   and it's just plain cool to see the work you do process on a machine which you wouldn't be able to see
		   otherwise.</p>   
		   
		<p>Some of my other hobbies include world travel, running, the outdoors, reading and cooking. During my
		   spring semester of sophomore year, I took advantage of the opportunity to study abroad in Florence, 
		   Italy to continue my engineering education. This in particular was a transition point in my life where
		   I discovered one of the things that mattered significantly to me: freedom. Going out and exploring new
		   places outside your comfort zone and seeking new beginnings upon each different visit. The type of 
		   discovery that changes your perspective forever. You know? It was pretty sweet! Upon my travels, some
		   places I went to include Paris, Istanbul, Spain (Madrid and Barcelona were winners), Budapest, Krakow,
		   Munich, Salzburg and even one of the tiniest countries out there -- Liechtenstein. I'm hoping to travel 
		   more of Northern Europe sometime very soon as well as portions of Asia and South America. And... who 
		   knows what's next?<p>
		   
		<p>Running has been something I've grown up with beginning in middle school, after developing a desire to 
		   compete with my classmates in the mile run. Eventually, I began running Track and Field starting in 8th
		   grade and continued through with it in High School, and now run and train for the love and fun of it. 
		   I definitely do enjoy the thrill of running a competitive 5k, 400, 800 or just going on an easy, mindless 
		   long run in beautiful weather without restraint or feeling any obligation to. I've also run a half marathon
		   and marathon in Spokane, WA as well and hope to do it again soon.</p>
		   
		<p>My cooking hobby doesn't really need much of a verbal explanation. I've only gotten in to it after my abroad
		   travels -- and I continue to pursue it today. You can see some of the things I've made in the past in my
		   photography section (once I get that up and running).</p>
