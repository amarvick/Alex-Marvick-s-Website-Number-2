		<h3><strong>PORTFOLIO</strong></h3>
		<p>Here is a list of some projects that I have worked on in my own individual time. Each are organized by
		   language, and code is available here! I'll get it on my <a href="http://www.github.com/amarvick">Github</a> 
		   profile soon.</p>
		<p>Actually, since I don't have code uploaded to Github quite yet, I've made it downloadable here on the portfolio.
		   Documents containing an 'exe' extension can only be opened on a Windows; if you're a part of the group being
		   discriminated against (ironically, like me) for having a Mac, you can click on the other link to read the 
		   code.</p><br><br><br>

	<!--JAVA-->
		
		<h1 class="portLanguage">Java</h1>
		<p class="portLangDescription">So I actually decided to pick up on Java just a few days after Christmas because
			I realized that in order to be a powerful web developer, front and back end languages are both very 
			essential. Amongst the few languages I could have learned; Java, PHP, Ruby, Scala, etc. I just had a nitch
			to learn Java since I know how powerful it is and it's a great way to learn OOP. I only have one program
			written in it so far, but it was a valuable learning experience and I hope to get even better at it
			soon and perhaps learn those other languages mentioned above!</p>
			
		<h3 class="projectTitle">Banking Game</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">In this game, two different classes are used; one being the program itself 
			that imports the other class, where all of the functions are represented. The computer prompts you 
			that you have $10000, and it asks how much of it you'd like to store in your checking and savings 
			account with the remainder in your pockets. The computer will continually give you a menu asking what 
			you'd like to do with your money; either make a deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, check 
			balances, or quit. There are some other options as well included that haven't been edited yet (you'll 
			notice a luck option and an option to check your items), and I'm not sure how I'm going to make those 
			parts but it's there for making the game more interesting. It's great extra practice, too.</p>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">There is no downloadable exe document for this program; however, you can look
			at the code for both of the classes used to make this program; where the program class is the one that 
			runs while importing code from the user class.</p>

	<!--HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT/jQuery-->
		
		<hr>
		<h1 class="portLanguage">HTML/CSS/JavaScript + jQuery</h1>
		<p class="portLangDescription">These languages were picked up in the summer of 2015, as I did most of my
	    	learning through Codecademy, a Udemy course and practice. While they're fun and pretty straight forward to learn 
	    	(especially JavaScript for me as I've done C++ prior to it), the learning process increases significantly
	    	once you get going on making webpages. It's best once you understand concepts, and what specific things mean;
	    	and if you forget something, you can easily look it up. Of course, I'd still like to continue to get better 
	    	at making these websites and get to the point where I can code in these languages in a manner equally 
	    	sophisticated as other websites including Airbnb, Facebook, etc.</p>
		
		<h3 class="projectTitle">Alex Marvick's Website: Take 1</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">This one looked pretty horrible. I think I got sick of it as soon as I realized the
			background colors didn't match; however, it was a great take as I ended up making a second draft (which being,
			the one you're looking at right now) and I don't think I would have been able to make this one without doing
			the first one and using it as a warmup.</p>
		<p class="htmlCssJs"><a href="index1.html">Check it out!</a></p>
		
		<h3 class="projectTitle">Alex Marvick's Website: Take 2 (This one!)</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">After the first website when I realized I wasn't going too far with it, I decided
			to start over and make this one instead. In my opinion, this take was significantly more successful; but again,
			the first one was a great start as it helped me figure out what went wrong and gave me the motivation to make
			those changes and put more care in to it.</p>
	    <p class="htmlCssJs"><a href="index.html">Link me back to the home page because it was cool!</a></p>
	    		
		<h3 class="projectTitle">Reddit API</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">This was a fun project I worked on with my brother on how to use the Reddit API
			via JavaScript. This program imports Reddit's JSON, and it shows the four most recent headings for different
			sections, depending on what you look up. For example, if you type 'aww' in the search box, JavaScript will
			find the first four most recent 'aww' articles and post their names, and can do this for any of the other
			headings searched.</p>
	    <p class="htmlCssJs"><a href="indexAPI.html">Check it out!</a></p>
			
		<h3 class="projectTitle">BBC News Website Replication</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">While it's not 100% finished, I did this for fun on August 31, 2015 and haven't 
			updated it since. (I bet people who read BBC are wondering when it'll be updated next...) It looks almost
			100% like the original website (obviously disregarding some of the sections missing), and hey, if you want
			to read those articles you see on there, it'll link you directly to them! (Except for the one about me...)
			This was done explicitly using HTML and CSS.</p>

	<!--C++-->
	   
		<h1 class="portLanguage">C++</h1>
		<p class="portLangDescription">As this was the first language I decided to pick up, I can say that I had a pretty 
			darn good time. These projects are all pretty rudimentary, and hopefully you can have some fun with the games, 
			even if they aren't the best of quality. I have over 40 of these, so I don't think I'll post every single one 
			of them... but, I'll post the ones that I think were pretty significant to my learning as I had just gotten 
			started. I realize people probably don't care about my first "Hello World" project -- and I wanted to pick ones 
			that you'd have fun actually looking at.</p>
		
		<h3 class="projectTitle">Cylindrical & Spherical Coordinates Conversion Calculator</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">In Calculus, you have the ability to take regular cartesian coordinates (x, y and z on a 3-dimensional
			plane) and convert them in to Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates. In both of these coordinate systems, you can
			think of creating a coordinate point on the edge of a Cylinder or a Sphere. To see how the calculations actually work,
			you'd have to read the code -- but if you're doing this unit in Calculus III and need to check your answers, feel
			free to do so with this program.</p>

		<h3 class="projectTitle">Hangman: Vectors</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">I think this will be the most appealing for any user who is just looking to play a fun game.
			This game has many different random words that could possibly be pulled out, and you can guess incorrectly
			up to 8 times before you become hung. This was done by using the basic concepts of vectors, while loops and
			if/else statements.</p>

		<h3 class="projectTitle">Hydrology Calculator</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">One day, I was sitting in my Hydrology class and was attempting to follow along these really
			intricate looking calculations in order to complete a table. We were required to have a computer with us to conduct
			these said calculations, and I decided "hey, why not just write code for it?", and I did just that during
			class. I don't really recall how it works, but maybe you could have some fun with it.</p>

		<h3 class="projectTitle">Madlibs using Multiple Functions</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">This was written using the concepts of multiple functions. Each function will 
			output a blank space in which the user is asked to fill in, and then the end result will print.</p>

		<h3 class="projectTitle">The MasterQuest</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">Perhaps one of the more fun projects I've worked on, this game requires the user to log in to
			the server to begin. There are only a few accounts that I've made available for people; therefore, you will
			have to sign in as a 'guest'. This won't impact the journey you'll be taking, however. All you have to do is
			input 'guest' for either the username or the password. This portion of the program uses the fundamentals of
			logical operators (&&, || and !=), while the actual journey that you'll be taking uses a combination of do loops,
			if/then statements, switch/case options as well as break/continue statements. There is a maximum possible score
			in this game -- if you play this and let me know what that maximum score is, that's cool!</p>

		<h3 class="projectTitle">The Number Guessing Game</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">In this game, a random number is selected to be guessed and you must be the first one to find
			that number before the computer. This enables the random number generator, as well as using some do loops. I guess
			I like them better than while loops, but I know the significance between each -- do loops will operate at least once,
			whereas while loops may not operate at all.</p>

		<h3 class="projectTitle">Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph"> This was my first Tic-Tac-Toe game written ever using the basic concepts of arrays. It's pretty 
			fun; it may not be as advanced or as sophisticated as Bill Gates's first Tic-Tac-Toe game he wrote when he was just
			learning how to code, but I still think you'd have fun with it. Unfortunately, for some reason I can't get the 
			program to settle in on a winner/tiebreaker as it will continue going once all the spaces are filled up. I may 
			change this eventually.</p>

		<h3 class="projectTitle">Word Scramble: Iterators and Vectors</h3>
		<p class="portfolioParagraph">In this Word Scramble game, this uses vectors as well as some of its operations
			for the user to guess the word. There are only four words available; if you can figure out what they were, 
			cool...</p>
